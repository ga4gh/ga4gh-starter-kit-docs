Samtools is a command line application that is ubiquitous in bioinformatics and genomics. It is generally used to summarize, filter, and manipulate alignment data (in SAM, BAM, or CRAM format). Here, Samtools will simply be used to count the number of reads in some test BAM files.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"cookbooks/samtools-view-drs-wes/run-using-drs-urls":{"id":"cookbooks/samtools-view-drs-wes/run-using-drs-urls","title":"Run samtools view on WES with DRS URLs as input","description":"In the previous section, we used direct https:// URLs as input BAM files to the samtools view workflow.
