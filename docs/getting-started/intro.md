# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the GA4GH Starter Kit. The Starter Kit is a suite of microservice applications, each acting as a server implementation of an approved **GA4GH API Specification** (e.g. DRS, WES, Beacon, htsget, refget).

If you're new here, please run the [Quickstart Tutorial](./quickstart), and see how to get up and running with GA4GH APIs with only a few commands.
