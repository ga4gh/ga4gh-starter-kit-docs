# GA4GH Starter Kit Docs

Documentation site for the GA4GH Starter Kit. Uses the [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) framework for static site building.

## Installation

Prequisites:
* nodejs version >= 12.13.0
* yarn (tested with version 1.19.0)

To install all dependencies, run:

## Local Development

```console

```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
